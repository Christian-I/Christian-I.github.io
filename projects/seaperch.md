<hr>

SeaPerch is an underwater ROV competition and community that guides over 250,000 students annually through a real-world engineering and design project [1].<br>

The competition consisted of a challenge course, an obstacle course, a techincal design report, and team video.<br>
The challenge course required our ROV to complete four different tasks including rotation and transportation of different objects across various platforms elevated above the pool floor.

I participated in SeaPerch while I was a student at James B. Castle High School from 2020-2022 with their robotics team the ProtoKnights.
During my senior year I was assigned to be a team lead and shroud designer. During this time I oversaw the design process of our ROV, Proto-E, named after Disney's WALL-E
