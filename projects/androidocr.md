## Introduction
This Android App was developed for my Fall â€˜23 Junior Project class at UH Manoa. The total time spent acquiring the adequate knowledge to develop the App plus the time to develop the app spans from that Summer in June to the end of the fall semester in December. This was also a solo project, supplemented by weekly meetings with the professor in charge of the class, Professor Sasaki. The app was designed with the goal of implementing an intermediate programming concept and/or having a moderate impact, the app I chose to develop focusing on the prior. With that being said, my app is named the OCR Bill Splitter App, developed using Kotlin and Android Studio and features machine learning vision as an intermediate programming concept.
