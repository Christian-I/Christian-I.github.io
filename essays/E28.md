## Setting the Attire
What often comes with repeated familiarity with a scenario is laziness. For exmaple, think about how much effort you put into your outfit on your first day in high school. Did you pay extra attention to how your hair was styled that morning, what kind of stickers you had on your water bottle, and the condition and designs of the clothing you were wearing? How about during your senior year of high school? Did you find yourself thinking about that same plethora of things?<br>

In a similiar fashion, after learning how to code in many different environments and with many different languages, aspiring software engineers frequently try to find shortcuts when it comes to working with different languages and tools. They start caring less about adding proper documentation or minimializations of design and more about producing a working program. They stop caring about how their code looks to others. It could be said these type of programmers don't suit up their code with the proper attire -- unfitting to be shown or logically perceived by others. That is where linters come in.<br>

## First Impressions

Linters ensure the code that you develop will always meet a certain *coding standard*, or set of guidelines for writing code. These coding standards help to ensure consistency across a project when it comes to approaching certain functionalities and when it comes to the ability for collobarating devlopers to read and maintain the code of the project. Your coding style at a job in the tech industry is like a second persona attached to you. If your coding style is stubborn and hard to read, your coworkers or future team working on your project will despise you, which is why the presentability of your code matters.<br>
Does learning coding standards serve a purpose to university coding students? My answer -- partially yes.<br><br>
The coding standards that I've had to conform to on VSCode using ESLint and TypeScript don't serve much of an educative purpose and more of an informative purpose and a heavy gamified aspect. Perhaps this is because we have not been dealt an environment where linters and coding standards don't have a stage to shine, but ESLint improves my learning experience with TypeScript, a language I am a month familiar with, by returning errors on poorly or vulnerable designs of code. Reporting and fixing these errors gamifies coding as VSCode and ESLint provide a fast and easy way to check errors in your program, including where you can find said errors and outside examples to reference, whether it be an actual error or coding standard violation.<br>

## Future Thoughts
With that being said, using these linters that enforce coding standards are a great passive way to introduce coding standards to software engineering students, especially with the "WOD" oriented tasks this class follows. Familiarity with knowing how to traverse different common tools such as IDEs, version control, and now linters -- I believe -- is the most important knowledge to get out of school as a software engineer. While we will not exercise the full capabilities and benefits of using these tools, we will **know how to learn how to use** these tools in the future, which in the quickly evolving world the tech industry is, is a much more important skill than learning just coding standards enforced by ESLint for TypeScript.
