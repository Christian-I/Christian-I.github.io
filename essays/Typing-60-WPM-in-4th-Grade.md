## Introduction
Growing up alongside the exponential growth of technological advancements in my childhood means I gained a lot of exposure to the products of the tech industry and their improvements making me happy in one way or another. One of the oldest memories I have is from logging onto the family iMac back in 2007, when I was two or three years old, selecting my Dad’s user profile and typing in the password so I could watch the powerpuff girls CD we rented from the library. Then came along the progression of the internet and websites such as YouTube, making my favorite cartoons and general entertainment more accessible. 

## The Path I Took
I picked up video games like Roblox and Minecraft on the computer and Mario and Pokemon on the Nintendo console line  from videos I watched on YouTube and played them frequently. I was around six years old at this point. I continued playing the same video games throughout elementary school, so much so that when we had our computer literacy (typing) class in the fourth grade, I did not need to look down to type and practice to commit the position of the keys to muscle memory. My muscle memory of typing on a keyboard was already proficient. In fact, I was able to type 60 WPM with high accuracy at that point. Alongside my computer literacy, my brain was also quick to pick up basic arithmetic and logical reasoning skills in the form of math as well as from my elementary school VEX Robotics team. Math was the only subject I enjoyed learning about in elementary school and I was placed in the honors class starting at that point all the way through high school. 

Speaking of high school, my obsession with video games, arithmetic, and logical reasoning showed no signs of stopping. Besides band and school work I was practically always playing video games. I took both AP computer science courses my school offered, took up to calculus two by the time I graduated, and participated in my school’s VEX and SeaPerch robotics clubs.. I only felt encouraged to take it this far however, as I felt all my schooling, support from teachers, advisors and friends, and other personal experiences led to me following the path of programming and engineering and those same components followed me up to that point. Now, more than ever, I feel more obliged to follow through with the experiences they have graced me with.


## Conclusion
Though my interests in programming as a career have shifted from video games and possibly developing video games to more just landing a sustainable secure career, those passions for programming and engineering to build something engaging and fun to provide to others flare up within me from time to time. I will continue to take in all the skills that my professors in college are guiding me to learn and put them to use in developing a bright future that I can live in and enjoy where I am able to repay my community by providing those same experiences and opportunities.  And possibly improve on my game development abilities when the time is more feasible.
