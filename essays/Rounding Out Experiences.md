## Introduction
<p>

Nearing the end of my Software Engineering I class, ICS 314, and bringing a close to my 5th semester of pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer engineering, it's time to reflect on the skills I gained and what they really represent in my future in software development. The core focus of ICS 314 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa was to develop technical skills with respect to web development, which the technology stack provided a solid foundation for, the real applications of this class extend much further than that. The real applications of this class can be found in any upcoming problems I will encounter in my future career in this field.
<br>
<br>
In this essay, I will reflect on my experiences working with User Interface Frameworks, Agile Project Management, and Open Source Software Development, and how these topics will contribute to my programming tool set.

## User Interface Frameworks
<p>
<i>User Interface Frameworks</i> (UI Frameworks), refer to a collection of tools, libraries, and templates coordinated into a single software to help developers create user interfaces for web or mobile applications. The components of these softwares heavily optimize the process of web development, and learning of which, by providing a standardized, heavily documented, and reusable environment to web developers. THe UI Frameworks used in this class included Bootstrap and React.
</p>
<p>
In this class, we started our journey in web development in raw html and css, then moved onto integrating bootstrap elements into our website code -- replacing the need for html and css, and finally graduated onto using React -- reducing the depth of the website code by replacing bootstrap elements and providing methods to reuse code.
