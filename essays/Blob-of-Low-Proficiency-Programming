## Pre-TypeScript
Developing profound knowledge for any specific programming language can take upwards of a year. Yet as students we’re expected to learn and retain skills for any one language from three monthThe semesters separated by ninety day summer breaks. Not to mention additional classes taken alongside programming-centered courses that require equal amounts of time and focus but I digress.<br>
From my personal experiences, learning the basics of a new programming language often feels like adding different colored blobs of Play-Doh on top of each other with no clear goal in sight. First, JavaScript, then Java, C, C++, Kotlin, Python, SQL, and now TypeScript, all over the span of four years.

*I find myself wondering how all these programming languages are supposed to contribute to my tool belt.*

With respect to my prior experiences in programming, I think TypeScript has been fairly easy for me to pick up early on as it is a superset of JavaScript which I spent a year learning, primarily with respect to syntax.<br> The design aspects I have picked up from C and C++ in college appear to be directly translatable to TypeScript as well, adding to my ease of learning so far.

## New Color to the Mix
Because of the many similarities, I cannot speak from my experiences on whether I believe TypeScript is a “good” or “bad” programming language as it just fits into that smear of programming languages I am familiar with.<br>
If I had a higher-proficiency with each of these languages to truly find the quirks and flaws in higher-level implementation, I believe then I would be able to discern the usefulness of a specific language, but for now my blob of low-proficiency languages has no stars or duds.


With that being said, there are a couple features of TypeScript that caught my attention. From the ES6 module of the Legacy JavaScript course on FreeCodeCamp, I was surprised by the kind of memory manipulation the ES6 destructuring syntax brings about. Compared to pointers in C, this attribute of TypeScript I found much more intuitive, hence FreeCodeCamp’s decision to include it towards the beginning of their TypeScript course.

## Molding the Blob
An additional tool I am using to learn TypeScript is the learning style the ICS 314 course approaches TypeScript with – athletic software engineering.<br>
Athletic software engineering was coined by one of our professors at UH Manoa who believed viewing coding as an athletic activity would lead to increased engagement and efficiency in learning how to program. 


My current experience with this includes repetition of practice WODs or short coding exercises and have started off fairly bland as the exercises were very elementary, though I did feel a hint of stress to code as fast as I could. 


In the very near future, I am very hopeful for facing challenges with this learning style. If this style does work out for me, maybe I could use it to meld my blob of programming skills into a cohesive figurine.
